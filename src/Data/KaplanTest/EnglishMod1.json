They also found that the subjects who consumed artificial sweeteners had different populations of bacteria in their guts compared to the subjects who did not, and they posit that artificial sweetener use was responsible for these differences."

The collision of the meteorites with the hot surface of the Earth caused fragments of the crust to cool and become buoyant patches to which additional material would adhere, forming continents.

On the night of the incident, the wheel landed on black a surprising 26 times in a row.

Fortunately, a new weapon has emerged in the battle against kudzu: goats.

Scientists now theorize that an additional moon called Chrysalis orbited Saturn until approximately 160 million years ago, when its orbit destabilized and the moon scraped the planet. The remnants of the crashed moon could be the source of Saturn’s rings, icy debris that orbits the planet. The rings are thought to have formed about 100 million years ago, long after the formation of Saturn itself but after Chrysalis’s theoretical destruction. Further, Chrysalis’s gravitational pull on Saturn before the collision and the lack of that pull after the collision—in conjunction with the gravitational influence of Saturn’s large planetary neighbor, Neptune—may help explain Saturn’s pronounced tilt on its axis.",

Pesticides, which are chemicals used to prevent pest infestation of crops on a large scale around the world, are often picked up by honeybees during their foraging and pollination flights. Scientists have found that more than one pesticide can be found in the honey of one hive. While the presence of one pesticide in a hive would certainly limit the life spans of bees and impair their navigational skills, some researchers theorize that the interaction of two or more pesticides could cause an entire colony to collapse. There are many ingredients in pesticides that are not regulated by world governments, and this leaves a lot of ground for bee scientists to cover when doing their research.",

For example, our brains do not fully comprehend the meaning of the word “pencil” apart from our familiarity with the physical actions of holding and writing with a pencil. Thus, a team at Osaka Metropolitan University hypothesized that the brain’s processing of the words for physical objects would be impacted if subjects’ body movements were limited. To evaluate this hypothesis, the researchers showed subjects pairs of words on a computer screen. When words for physical objects, such as “cup” and “broom” were displayed, researchers asked the subjects to compare the objects’ relative sizes. Some subjects’ hands were restrained, while others could move their hands freely.",

    "passage": "In Japan, adults may be legally adopted into a family. The practice may have started as early as the 13th century CE, but widespread adult adoption dates from the Tokugawa shogunate, a military government which began around 1600 CE. During this time, members of the ruling class would adopt competent adult males, who would then ensure that the family’s political and business interests would be sustained. While adult adoption remains a way for individuals to improve their economic and social status, the practice has its detractors as well, with some researchers arguing that it can lead to issues with the adoptee developing a firm sense of identity in his or her new environment.",
